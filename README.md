# SWMPtides <img src="https://r-pkg.org/badges/version-last-release/devtools" align="right"/>
An experimental project for ceating an R package for generating visual predictive tide tables for all SWMP stations - Be gentile. It's my first R package
A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

    What the project does
		Ideally the SWMPtides package extracts principal tidal constituents from archived observed water level data collected at NERRS System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) stations. From this the package will generate tables and plots of futre tides and water levels. The package relies heavily on the TideHarmonics model builds upon it to  includes tools for:
		-Predicting tides for any future month/year
		-Extracting high and low tide events
		-Saving tide tables as CSV files
		-Plotting monthly tide curves with highs/lows
		-(coming soon) Calendar-style daily tide summaries
      
    Why the project is useful
      If things work out the way I hope the SWMPtides package will acquire NERRS SWMP water quality data, use historical depth data to generate tide tables in .csv format. These tables can be used to plot calendards with predicted times and water levels for high and low tides at selected days in the future. Hopefullly at some ponit in the future these could be available in webpage form using shiny or something similar that I haven't learned yet. Would also be nice to view predicted with observed water levels.
